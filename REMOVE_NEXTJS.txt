Remove these leftover Next.js files:
- next.config.js
- next-env.d.ts

You can safely delete them from your project root.

No /pages directory or .next build output was found.

To use Express for API calls to swapi.dev (Star Wars API):

1. In your Express server (server.js), add a route to proxy requests:

app.get('/api/people', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    let allPeople = [];
    let nextUrl = 'https://swapi.dev/api/people/';
    while (nextUrl) {
      const response = await fetch(nextUrl);
      if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to fetch people');
      const data = await response.json();
      allPeople = [...allPeople, ...data.results];
      nextUrl = data.next;
    }
    res.json(allPeople);
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: err.message });
  }
});

2. In your React app, change the fetch URL in PeopleContext.tsx from 'https://swapi.dev/api/people/' to '/api/people'.

This way, your frontend calls your Express backend, which fetches from swapi.dev, avoiding CORS and hiding API details.

You do NOT need SSR for this patternâ€”just a working Express backend.
