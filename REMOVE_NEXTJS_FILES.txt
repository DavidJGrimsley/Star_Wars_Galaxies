Delete these files to fully remove Next.js from your project:
- next.config.js
- next-env.d.ts

You can also remove any .next directory if it appears after a build.

No /pages directory was found, so no action needed there.

Your project is now set up to use Express as a backend API proxy for SWAPI calls. No SSR is required for this pattern.
